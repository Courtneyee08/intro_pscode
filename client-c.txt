Task C
1. Count the number of packages, starting at "2" for the first package.
2. For each package after the first package, increment by 2 each time a package is counted (Since each package contains two items). 
3. Stop when you get to the 50th package. 
4. Each time a package is counted, store that number in variable called "ncount".
5. Print out "ncount" to obtain the total number of items in one case.
